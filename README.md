# dotfiles
My personal preference files "dotfiles" for Linux. Feel free to look 
around, and fork it if you want.

## Installation
This repo includes the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) 
installer as a submodule, so all you need to do install is run the 
following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4U6U57/dotfiles && dotfiles/install
```
