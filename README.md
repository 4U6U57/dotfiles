# dotfiles
My personal preference files "dotfiles" for Linux. Feel free to look around, and fork it if you want.

## Installation
This repo includes the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) installer as a submodule, 
so all you need to do to apply the preferences is run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4U6U57/dotfiles && cd dotfiles && ./install
```

Check out the dotbot repo for more info on that, I highly recommend it.
